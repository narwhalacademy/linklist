# Roll your own linklist (a short tutorial)

Last updated February 24, 2021

## Why bother?

Building your own linklist using HTML and CSS is like having your own [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), but it's infinitely more customizable. Plus, it's nice to not have to rely on commercial services sometimes, who, even if they're not charging you, are probably slurping your data for commercial gain.

## How to do it

- [Download this repository](https://github.com/narwhalacademy/linklist/archive/main.zip) to your computer
- Edit `index.html` to change the text, links, fonts and colors
- Replace the images in the `img` folder. Then, if necessary, change the referenced filenames in `index.html`
- Optional: edit `main.css` for finer control over the layout 
- Test it by opening `index.html` in a web browser on your computer
- Upload the contents of this repository onto a web host

## What's files are in this repository

- `index.html` â€” the main web page, which we've made easy to edit
- `main.css` - advanced styling settings, edit if you want more control
- `normalize.css` - standardizes styling defaults across different computers
- `README.md` - this tutorial document that you're reading right now
- `img\background-image.jpg` - our background image of the sea
- `img\bottom-image.png` - our images of narwhals hanging at the bottom
- `img\profile-picture.png` - our profile picture

## For more information

- If you're not sure what a web host is, we recommend starting a free account on [Neocities](https://neocities.org) and starting out on there.
- To edit `index.html`, simply open it any text editing program (TextEdit on OSX, Notepad on Windows)
- Colors can be set in three ways:
  1. Named colors like "black" and "white". [See the full list on Encyclorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/named).
  2. Hexademical codes like #000000 and #FFFFFF.
  3. RGBA values that let you set rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) values.
- `rem` is a standard unit of length/size. Try not to accidentally delete it!
